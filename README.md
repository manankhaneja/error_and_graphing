# error_and_graphing
Many of the experiments in basic undergraduate physics laboratories involve
verifying some law or already established theoretical dependence of a quantity
of interest on some tunable parameters (independent variables) - given by some
functional dependence. Often, error analysis is not done with rigour and as a
result, questions like, what are the limits of the experimental setup, what is the
effect of the conditions in which the experiment is done, remain unanswered.

There are hundreds of errors that can creep into our measurements but all
of them cannot be modeled. Instead, what we can do is model reading errors for
observations and work on statistical averages for multiple observations of the
same thing to determine the effect of surrounding change and variability in the
system. The main objective of this work is to help in effective calculation and
modelling of errors and gaining useful insights in data.
